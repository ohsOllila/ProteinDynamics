calcNHcorrelationFUNCTSwithAMBER.sh is an example of script that I have used to calculate rotational correlation functions

analyzeROTATIONALdynamics.sh runs the python scripts to calculate rotational diffusion coefficients

plotR1amber.m and plotR1amberSCALEDrotation.m calculates the R1, R2 and NOE for correlation functions from correlation functions from original simulation and correlation functions with corrected rotional diffusion constant
