\section{Introduction}
Conformational sampling and entropy of proteins
play a significant role in functionality
and interactions with other biomolecules.
In addition to internal dynamics due to conformation sampling, the
proteins also experience overall brownian tumbling.
These properties are experimentally accessible through 
spin relaxation times of $^{15}$N and $^{13}$C nucleai measured
with nuclaer magnetic resonance (NMR) 
techniques \cite{jarymowycz06,korzhnev01,bedem15,lewandowski15,lamley15}. 
Spin relaxation rate experiments have been used to, for example, analyze
conformational entropies \cite{kasinath13,allner15,jarymowycz06}, binding entropies \cite{akke93,jarymowycz06},
resolve sampled structures \cite{bedem15}
and validate molecular dynamics simulations \cite{best04,showalter07a,showalter07b,maragakis08,trbovic08}.
These analyzes are almost exclusively based on the
separation of internal conformational sampling 
and overall rotational tumbling \cite{wennerstrom79,Lipari82} and
isotropic overall diffusion is often assumed, while
analysis of anisotropic molecules is significantly more
complicated \cite{jarymowycz06,korzhnev01,luginbuhl97,hall04}.
Thus, new approaches are needed to intepret spin relaxation times
measured from anisotropic or intrinsically disordered molecules.


%This approach has been successfully applied for large amount of proteins
%with isotropic shape and overall rotational diffusion \cite{jarymowycz06}.
%The resulting order parameters and overall rotational diffusion coefficients
%
%, however, proteins
%with anisotropic shape or large amount of internal motional timescales
%are 
%proteins parameter space for fitted parameters become
%rotational diffusion and internal flexibility of proteins and other biomolecules.
%On the other hand, segmental level information has been used in validation
%and improvement of molecular dynamics simulation force fields \cite{??}.
%Segmental order has been also related to conformational entropy of proteins \cite{??}.

 
Classical molecular dynamics simulation methods are
promising tools to interpretate spin relaxation time experiments
for molecules with significant anisotropy or correlations between
internal and overall rotational motions. Practical applications
are, however, limited by inaccuracies in the force field descriptions
and available time scales in the simulations \cite{prompers02,maragakis08,trbovic08,wong08,anderson12}.
The overestimation of overall rotational diffusion due to inaccuracies in 
water models~\cite{wong08} and very long simulations required to calculate rotational
correlation functions with sufficient accuracy from single molecules in MD
simulations \cite{lu06,anderson12} have been the main complications.

In this work we overcome these issues by assuming that the overall
rotational dynamics of protein follows
anisotropic rigid body diffusion around inertia axes. 
Diffusion coefficients are directly calculated from angular displacements of
protein intertia axes and used to determine overall rotation part
of backbone N-H bonds correlation functions.
This reduces the simulation length required for accurate determination
of rotational correlation functions. Furthermore, the overestimated
rotational diffusion due to water model can be anisotropically corrected
by scaling the diffusion coefficients in all directions with a constant
factor. The approach is demonstrated by interpreting the experimental
spin relaxation times of HpTonB-92 \cite{ciragan16} and PsTonB \cite{??}
protein constructs, both having significantly anisotropic shape. 
These protein segments are critical for iron transport into Helicbacteri
Pyroli and Pseudomonas bacteria, respectively.


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Spin relaxation experiments and rotational dynamics of molecules}
Molecular dynamics of protein backbone residues and spin relaxation experiments can
be connected by using the spectral density $J(\omega)$ 
\begin{equation}\label{SPECTdens}
  J(\omega)=2\int_0^\infty C(t) \cos(\omega t) {\rm d}t,
\end{equation}
which is the Fourier transformation of the second order
rotational correlation function for N-H bond vector
\begin{equation}\label{CORRFdef}
  C(t)=\langle \frac{3}{2}\cos^2\theta_{t'+t}-\frac{1}{2} \rangle_{t'},
\end{equation}
where $\theta_{t'+t}$ is the N-H bond angle between times $t'$ and $t'+t$
and angular brackets refer to the ensemble average.
Connection to experimentally measured spin relaxation times $T_1$, $T_2$
and $T_{\rm NOE}$ is given by Redfield equations \cite{abragam,kay89}
\begin{equation}\label{R1}
  \begin{aligned}
  \frac{1}{T_1}= & \frac{d_{\rm{NH}}^2N_{\rm{H}}}{20}\bigg[J(\omega_{\rm{H}}-\omega_{\rm{N}})+3J(\omega_{\rm{N}})+6J(\omega_{\rm{N}}+\omega_{\rm{H}})\bigg] \\
        & +\frac{(\sigma \omega_{\rm{N}})^2}{15}j(\omega_{\rm{N}}),
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{R2}
    \begin{aligned}
  \frac{1}{T_2}= & \frac{1}{2}\frac{d_{\rm{NH}}^2N_{\rm{H}}}{20}\bigg[4J(0)+3j(\omega_{\rm{N}})+J(\omega_{\rm{H}}-\omega_{\rm{N}})+6J(\omega_{\rm{H}})  \\
    & +6J(\omega_{\rm{N}}+\omega_{\rm{H}})\bigg]+\frac{(\sigma \omega_{\rm{N}})^2}{90}[4J(0) +3J(\omega_{\rm{N}})],
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{NOE}
  \frac{1}{T_{\rm NOE}}=1+\frac{d_{\rm{NH}}^2N_{\rm{H}}}{20}\bigg[6J(\omega_{\rm{N}}+\omega_{\rm{H}})+J(\omega_{\rm{H}}-\omega_{\rm{N}}))\bigg]\frac{\gamma_{\rm{H}}}{\gamma_{\rm{N}}R_1},
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{\rm{N}}$ and $\omega_{\rm{H}}$ are the Larmor angular
frequencies of $^{15}$N and $^1$H respectively, and
$N_{\rm{H}}$ is the number of bound protons.
The dipolar coupling constant is given by
\begin{equation}
d_{\rm{NH}}=-\frac{\mu_0\hbar\gamma_{\rm{H}}\gamma_{\rm{N}}}{4\pi\langle r_{\rm{CN}}^3\rangle},\nonumber
\end{equation}
where $\mu_0$ is the magnetic constant or vacuum permeability, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant,
$\gamma_{\rm{N}}$ and $\gamma_{\rm{H}}$ are the gyromagnetic constants of $^{15}$N and $^1$H, respectively.
Average cubic length is calculated as $\langle r_{\rm{CN}}^3\rangle = (0.101{\rm nm})^3$ and the 
value of $\Delta \sigma = -160$ ppm is used for the chemical shift anisotropy of N-H bonds in 
proteins \cite{kay89,hiyama88}.
%Same equations can be used, for example, to C-H bond by changing the
%constants related to nitrogen to the ones corresponding carbon. 

Spin relaxation experiments are typically interpreted by
dividing the rotational dynamics in overall tumbling 
and internal relaxation due to conformational sampling 
and assuming that the motions are 
independent \cite{wennerstrom79,Lipari82,jarymowycz06,korzhnev01}.
The rotational correlation function for chemical bonds can be then written as
\begin{equation}\label{CORRFsep}
  C(t)=C_I(t)C_O(t),
\end{equation}
where $C_I(t)$ and $C_O(t)$ are correlation functions for internal and overall
rotations, respectively. Conformational sampling can be described
in this approximation by using the square of order parameter respect to 
molecular axes $S^2$, which is given by the plateau of the internal rotational 
correlation function, and the effective correlation time 
\begin{equation}\label{effCT}
  \tau_{\rm eff}=\int_0^\infty C_I'(t) \mathrm{d}t,
\end{equation}
where $C_I'(t)=\frac{C_I-S^2}{1-S^2}$ is the reduced correlation function \cite{Lipari82}.

The overall rotational correlation function is often described
by approximating protein as a rigid body, which gives 
a sum of five exponentials for fully anisotropic molecule \cite{woessner62,korzhnev01}
\begin{equation}\label{CORRFanisot}
  C_O(t)=\sum_{j=1}^5 A_j e^{-t/\tau_j},
\end{equation}
where time constants $\tau_j$ are related 
to the diffusion constants around
three principal axes of a molecule
($D_{xx}$, $D_{yy}$ and $D_{zz}$)  
\footnote{
$\tau_1=(4D_{xx}+D_{yy}+D_{zz})^{-1}$,
$\tau_2=(D_{xx}+4D_{yy}+D_{zz})^{-1}$,
$\tau_3=(D_{xx}+D_{yy}+4D_{zz})^{-1}$,
$\tau_4=[6(D+(D^2-L^2)^{-1/2}]^{-1}$,
$\tau_5=[6(D-(D^2-L^2)^{-1/2}]^{-1}$,
$D=\frac{1}{3}(D_{xx}+D_{yy}+D_{zz})$ and 
$L^2=\frac{1}{3}(D_{xx}D_{yy}+D_{xx}D_{zz}+D_{yy}D_{zz})$}
and prefactors $A_j$ to the directions of chemical bonds 
respect to the molecular axes \cite{woessner62,luginbuhl97}.

The simplest approach to extract molecular dynamics from experimental
data is the original ''model free analysis'', where
isotropic diffusion for overall rotational correlation function and
monoexponential decay with time constant $\tau_{\rm eff}$ for internal correlation
function are assumed \cite{Lipari82}. Equation \ref{CORRFanisot} reduces to monoexponential
for isotropic diffusion and the overall dynamics can be described with a single
time constant $\tau_c$. Dynamics for each residue can be described with internal rotational relaxation 
time $\tau_{\rm eff}$ and the order parameter $S^2$. For this simple model
the parameters can be successfully fitted to the experimental data,
however the fitting becomes significantly more difficult for proteins 
with anisotropic overall diffusion or several internal timescales \cite{dosset00,luginbuhl97,jarymowycz06}.
Alternative approach is to describe overall protein diffusion with hydrodynamical
calculations \cite{torre00}. These are less problematic for anisotropic systems but
are sentitive for the assumptions about protein hydration shell \cite{torre00}.

%Standard analyses of experimental relaxation data usually assume
%fully or axially isotropic overall rotational motion and single
%decay constant for interal motion. Then the free parameters
%($S^2$, $\tau_j$, $A_j$) are fit against spin relaxation data
%from experiments. This gives most likely very good results for
%isotropic molecules for which the assumption of single internal
%motional timescale is reasonable. However, for molecules with
%significant shape anisotropy or several timescales in internal
%motions the amoount parameters to be fitted becomes large compared
%with the typical amount of experimental points.

%Two different approaches have been commonly used to analyze
%rotational dynamics from NMR relaxation experiments. In
%''model free analysis'' the fundamental idea is to separate
%interal dynamics from global rotation and assume exponential
%forms for rotational correlation functions. The parameters of
%rotational correlation functions are then fitted the experimental
%data to solve time scales and order parameters for different dynamical
%processes \cite{dosset00,??}.



%Spin relaxation data is usually analyzed by describing the sampled bond
%orientations with order parameter $S^2$ respect to the protein reference frame
%and assuming that overall and internal motions are independt \cite{??,korzhnev01}.
%Order parameters and timescales for overall and internal motions can be then
%extracted by fitting various functional forms to spin relaxation data
%measured with different magnetic field strengths \cite{jarymowycz06,korzhnev01}.

%\begin{equation}
%  C'_I(t)= e^{-t/\tau_c},
%\end{equation}


\subsection{Rotational dynamics from molecular dynamics simulations}\label{MDanalysis}
Classical molecular dynamics simulation gives a trajectory for each atom in
a system as a function of time. Rotational correlation functions for each bond
can be directly calculated from the trajectories by using Eq. \ref{CORRFdef}
and then used to calculate the spin relaxation times through Eqs. \ref{SPECTdens}-\ref{NOE}.
The resulting values can be compared to experimental data in order to assess simulation model
quality \cite{best04,showalter07a,showalter07b,maragakis08,trbovic08,fisette12} or
interpret experiments \cite{fisette12}. The comparison is often complicated by
statistical fluctuations of calculated correlation functions with time scales
corresponding the overall rotational diffusion. 
Here we reduce the fluctuations by calculating the overall rotational diffusion coefficients
directly from angular displacements of intertia axes.
The overall rotation is then assumed to have rotational correlation function of anisotropic rigid body
rotation, Eq. \ref{CORRFanisot}, and the timescales are determined from 
rotational diffusion coefficients~\cite{Note1}. Calculation of diffusion coefficients is
based on fitting a slope on linear mean square angle deviation (see below),
thus it is numerically more robust and requires less simulation data than a direct fit of
multiexponential sum in Eq. \ref{CORRFanisot} to the rotational correlation function calculated from MD
simulation.

The analysis can be divided in essentially six steps: \\
1) Total rotational correlation functions $C(t)$
for protein N-H bonds are directly calculated from MD simulation trajectory
by applying Eq.~\ref{CORRFdef}. \\
2) Rotational correlation functions for internal
dynamics $C_I(t)$ are calculated from MD simulation trajectory from where the overall
rotation of protein is removed. \\
3) The overall and internal motions are assumed to be independent and overall
rotational correlation function is calculated as $C_O(t)=C(t)/C_I(t)$ according to Eq. \ref{CORRFsep}. \\
4) The protein axes of inertia and mean square angle deviations of rotation around the axes
are calculated as function of time from MD simulation trajectory. \\
5) Rotational diffusion constants $D_x$, $D_y$ and $D_z$ are calculated by fitting a straight line
to the mean square angle deviations of inertia axes 
\begin{equation}\label{DIFFdef}
  \begin{aligned}
    \langle \Delta \alpha_{t'+t}^2 \rangle_{t'} = 2 D_{x} t \\
    \langle \Delta \beta_{t'+t}^2 \rangle_{t'} = 2 D_{y} t \\
    \langle \Delta \gamma_{t'+t}^2 \rangle_{t'} = 2 D_{z} t, \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\langle \Delta \alpha_{t'+t}^2 \rangle_{t'}$,
$\langle \Delta \beta_{t'+t}^2 \rangle_{t'}$ and
$\langle \Delta \gamma_{t'+t}^2 \rangle_{t'}$ are mean
square angle deviations of rotation around protein intertia axes
from shortest to longest, respectively.\\
6) Rigid body rotational correlation functions for anisotropic motion
are determined from Eq.~\ref{CORRFanisot}. Timescales $\tau_j$ are given by
rotational diffusion constants from previous step~\cite{Note1} and weighting
factors $A_j$ are determined by fitting the equation to overall
rotational correlation functions from MD simulations $C_0(t)$ determined in step 3. \\
7) Rigid body rotational correlation functions from previous step
are combined with internal rotational correlation functions from MD simulations (step 2)
by using Eqs. \ref{CORRFsep} and \ref{CORRFanisot} to determine
new correlation functions
\begin{equation}\label{newCORRF}
  C_N(t)=C_I(t)\sum_{j=1}^5 A_j e^{-t/\tau_j}.
\end{equation}
These correlation functions are then used to calculate spin relaxation times
from Eqs. \ref{SPECTdens}-\ref{NOE}. The incorrect overall rotational
diffusion due to water model can be corrected  by scaling the rotational diffusion
coefficients, i.e. timescales $\tau_j$, with a constant factor before calculating
new correlation functions from Eq. \ref{newCORRF}.



\subsection{Simulation and analysis details}
All simulations were ran using Gromacs 5 \cite{abraham15}
and Amber ff99SB- ILDN~\cite{lindorff10} force field for proteins . The proteins were solvated
to tip3p\cite{jorgensen83}, tip4p \cite{jorgensen83} or OPC4 \cite{izadi14} water models.
Initial structures were taken from NMR structures published elsewhere for PsTonB \cite{??}
and HpTonB-92 \cite{ciragan16}. 
Temperature was coupled to desired value with v-rescale thermistat \cite{bussi07} and pressure was 
isotropically set to 1 bar using Parrinello-Rahman barostat \cite{parrinello81}.
Timestep was 2~fs, Lennart-Jones interactions were cut-off at 1.0~nm,
PME~\cite{darden93,essman95} was used for electrostatics and LINCS was used
to constraint all bond lengths \cite{hess07}. Simulation trajectory and related
files are available at \cite{??}. The simulated systems are listed
in Table \ref{ROTdiffCOEFFS}

Rotational correlation functions are calculated with {\it gmx rotacf} from
Gromacs package \cite{gromacsMANUAL}. Overall rotation was removed
for $C_I(t)$ calculation by using fit option in {\it gmx trjconv}
from Gromacs package \cite{gromacsMANUAL}. The order parameters $S^2$
were determined by averaging rotational correlation functions from
oriented trajectory, $C_I(t)$, over lag times above 50~ns. Effective correlation times were then
calculated by using Eq.~\ref{effCT}. 
Inertia axes of protein were calculated with {\it compute\_inertia\_tensor}
function from MDTraj python library~\cite{McGibbon2015MDTraj}.

Spectral density was calculated by fitting a
sum of 471 exponentials with timescales from 1 ps to 50 ns
with logarithmic spacing
\begin{equation}\label{gprime_fit}
C_N(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_i e^{-t/\tau_i}
\end{equation}
to the new correlation function from Eq.~\ref{newCORRF}
by using the {\it lsqnonneg} routine in MATLAB \cite{matlab}.
The Fourier transform was then calculated by using analytical function
for the sum of exponentials 
\begin{equation}\label{FTanal}
J(\omega) =  4 \sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_i\frac{\tau_i}{1+\omega^2\tau_i^2}.
\end{equation}
Similar approach is used previously for lamellar systems in combination
with solid state NMR experiements \cite{nowacka13,ferreira15}.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Global rotational dynamics of protein}
Mean square angle deviations for rotation around inertia axes
of PsTonB protein in simulation with OPC4 water model
are shown in Fig. \ref{RMASDplot}. This is the longest
simulation data set in this work (1.2$\mu$s) and
linear behaviour of mean square angle deviations are observed
for the lag times up to one hundreth of the total simulation length (12~ns),
which is expected to be the maximum lag time for a good statistics
for rotational dynamics analyzed from a single molecule in MD simulations \cite{lu06}.
Deviations from linear behaviour are only seen with lag times longer
than this limit, as also demonstrated for shorter simulations in
Figs.~\ref{RMASDplotLOG310}~and~\ref{RMASDplotLOG298}.
Plot with log-log scale in Fig.~\ref{RMASDplot} B)
reveals a weakly subdiffusive region only below very short timescales
of approximately~0.12~ns. Thus, we conclude that the protein
experiences brownian rotational tumbling with  a good approximation
and that the diffusion coefficients can be calculated from the slope of mean square angle
deviations according to Eq. \ref{DIFFdef} by using lag times less than
one hundreth of the total MD simulation length.

\end{figure*}

The resulting rotational diffusion constants from different simulations are
shown in Table \ref{ROTdiffCOEFFS}. The values are larger than would be
expected from experiments for different proteins with similar
size~\cite{krishnan98}, especially when tip3p water model is used.
This is in line with previously reported simulation results,
where the results were explained by overestimated water self
diffusion \cite{wong08}. As expected, rotational diffusion coefficients
increase with the temperature and decreasing size of a protein.

The rotational diffusion coefficients are used to determine
the timescales $\tau_j$ for anisotropic rigid body rotation in Eq. \ref{CORRFanisot}~\cite{Note1},
which used as an approximation for the overall rotational dynamics of a protein.
The prefactors $A_j$ are determined by fitting the equation to overall rotational
correlation functions, $C_O(t)$, calculated from MD simulations.
The resulting rigid body rotational correlation function is then
combined with internal correlation function, $C_I(t)$,
to determine the new correlation functions from Eq.~\ref{newCORRF}.
%The 
%new correlation function has less fluctuations with longer time
%scales, thus giving more robust spin relaxation times. 

This analysis is exemplified in Fig.~\ref{exampleCORRF} for residues
in different parts of PsTonB protein having different features in rotational dynamics.
Flexible C-terminus is represented by residue 341,
more rigid $\beta$-sheet by residue 331 and a
flexible loop between two sheets by residue 322. 
The total correlation functions $C(t)$ in Fig.~\ref{exampleCORRF} A) (solid lines),
calculated from original MD trajectories,
decay toward zero within~$\sim$10-50~ns for all residues. 
Internal correlation functions $C_I(t)$ in Fig.~\ref{exampleCORRF} B),
calculated from trajectory with removed overall rotation of the protein,
decay to a plateau value, which defines the square of the order parameter $S^2$.
As expected, the $\beta$-sheet residue 331 has the largest order parameter value
and fastest decay to it, while order parameters for the loop and C-terminus residues are
significantly smaller and deacay is slower due to larger conformational ensemble
sampled by these regions. The overall rotational correlation functions $C_O(t)$
for a protein, determined as $C_O(t)=C(t)/C_I(t)$, are shown in Fig.~\ref{exampleCORRF} C) (solid lines).

The correlation functions are indistinguishable from original MD simulation results
with lag times shorter than one hundredth of total simulation time (approximately 4-12ns for the studied systems),

good approximations for the studied system. Thus, we conclude that

\subsection{Global rotational dynamics in simulations and experiments}
%Spin relaxation times from MD simulations and NMR experiments \cite{??} are compared
%in Figs. \ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATA} and \ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATA}
%for HpTonB-92 and PsTonBsystems, respectivelty. 
%Rotational correlation functions from simulations were determined by using
%Eq. \ref{newCORRF}, where internal correlation functions were taken from
%MD simulations, timescales were determined from protein overall rotation
%diffusion constants and prefactors from the fit to the MD simulation data,
%as decribed in previous section. The correlation functions were used to calculate
%spectral densities from Eqs.~\ref{gprime_fit}-\ref{FTanal} and
%spin relaxation times were then calculated from Eqs.~\ref{R1}-\ref{NOE}.

Spin relaxation times from HpTonB-92 simulations and experiments are
compared in Fig.~\ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATA}. Simulation results with
tip4p water model are in good agreement with experiments.
However, simulations with tip3p water model are significantly
off from experiments and underestimate $T_1/T_2$ ratio, suggesting too
fast overall rotational diffusion dynamics \cite{carper97} 
in agreement with previous studies \cite{wong08}. Indeed, division
of diffusion constants by a constant factor of 2.9 before applying
Eq. \ref{newCORRF} brings spin relaxation times in good agreement with experiments,
as shown in Fig. \ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATAscaled}.

Spin relaxation times from PsTonB simulations and experiments are 
compared in Fig. \ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATA}. Simulations with tip4p
or OPC4 water models systemically underestimate $T_1$ values
and $T_1/T_2$ ratio when compared with experiments, but much less
extent than in HpTonB-92 simulations with tip3p above. 
Dividing the diffusion coefficinents with a constant factor of 1.2 gives a good agreement for
spin relaxation rates between tip4p simulation and experiments at 298K,
as seen in Fig.~\ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATAscaled}.
The effect of temperature difference of 12 degrees is significanlty
smaller than the difference between simulations and experiments or the effect
of the diffusion constant scaling.

The good agreement between spin relaxation data from experiments and
simulations with scaled diffusion coefficients suggests that the values
can be used to interpret the anisotropic diffusion of these proteins
from the measured NMR data. The scaled rotational diffusion coefficients
from MD models giving the best agreement with experimental spin relaxation
data are shown in Table \ref{ROTdiffCOEFFS}. The scaled diffusion coefficients
from tip3p simulations were chosen for HpTonB-92, because they give
slightly better overall agreement with experiments than simulations with
tip4p water model. The results are in line with values for more isotropic
proteins, which are previously determined by different methods to interpret
the spin relaxation data \cite{krishnan98}.

\subsection{Interpretation of protein internal relaxation from MD simulations}
Experimental spin relaxation times can be reproduced by MD simulations
when overall rotational diffusion is corrected by scaling with a constant factor,
as seen in Figs. \ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATAscaled} and \ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATAscaled}.
These simulations can be used to interpret internal relaxation processes
observed in spin relaxation experiments for proteins.

NMR experiments and the most realistic MD simulation based model for HpTonB-92
show very little variation between spin relaxation times for
different residues in  as seen in Fig. \ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATA}.
This indicates a rigid protein structure, which is also seen in
MD simulation snapshots overlayed in Fig. \ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATA} A).
Enhanced conformational sampling is seen only for few residues in terminal
ends, which are also visible in spin relaxation data.
Some deviation from average spin relaxation times are observed also
between residues 210-222, which probably arises from sampling between
two orientations of the $\alpha$-helix (see discussion below and in Ref. \cite{??}).
Exceptionally low order parameters and long effetive correlation times
are also observed for residues 245-250 in simulations and the same region
gives small $T_1$ times in experiments. However, the interpretation of
these observations is not straightforward, because low $T_1$ in this region
are not reproduced by simulations. More detailed discussion together with
longer HpTonB construct is presented elsewhere \cite{??}.

More variety in internal dynamics between residues is observed for PsTonB protein,
as seen in Fig. \ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATAscaled}. Segments
with enhanced conformational sampling are labelled with yellow colour
in Fig. \ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATAscaled} A).
The terminal ends show significantly enhanced conformational sampling
in MD simulation snapshots, which is also observed in spin relaxation times
from simulations and experiments. The terminal ends are also characterized
by low order parameters and long effective internal correlation times
arising from larger amount of sampled conformations.
Enhanced conformational sampling is also observed for residues between 320-326,
which is a loop between two $\beta$-sheets.
MD simulations predict low order parameters and long internal effective correlation
times are also for residues between 260-274, which similar region
as residues 210-222 in HpTonB-92. In this case the simulations reveal
two different orientations sampled by the $\alpha$-helix in this region
(colour labelled with pink in Fig.~\ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATA} A)), which
also explains the lower resolution in NMR spectra for this region
observed for PsTonB and HpTonB constructs \cite{??}.
%In addition to Spin relaxation rate deviations from baseline
%are observed for residues 246-251 in N-terminus,
%and residues 338-342 in C-terminus.
%Also order parameters are low and effective internal
%relaxation times long for these segements as seen in Fig. \ref{??} B).
%In addition, low order parameters and larger effective correlation times
%are observed for PsTonB residues 260-274 and 300-303
%in Fig. \ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATA} B).
%Low order parameters and large
%effective correlation times between residues 300-303 are not seen
%in spin relaxation data, thus it is not clear if these arise from
%simulation artefact.

Relaxation processes can be further quantified by analysing the timescales,
which lead to spin relaxation times in agreement with experiments.
This is exemplified in Fig. \ref{coeffsPLOT} by plotting the prefactors corresponding
each timescale after fitting Eq. \ref{gprime_fit} to MD simulation data. 
The same residues for PsTonB as in Fig. \ref{exampleCORRF} are used.
Rotational relaxation of residue 331 in $\beta$-sheet is dominated
by overall rotational timescales of $\sim$5.5~ns and $\sim$8~ns, while
contribution from fast internal motions is much smaller, as expected for rigid
structure with large order parameter value. Rotational
relaxation of residue 322 in flexible loop is also dominated by
overall rotation timescales around $\sim$8~ns, but fast motions
from internal dynamics are more significant than for the $\beta$-sheet
residue in agreement with lower order parameter value in the loop.
On the other hand, rotational dynamics of residue 341 in N-terminal is dominated by timescales
below 3~ns related to the internal protein relaxation. The contribution from timescales
close to $\sim$13~ns is probably related to slow conformational sampling of
N-terminus, rather than overall rotational dynamics. This is in agreement with
Fig. \ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATA}, suggesting that sampling of large amount of
conformations leads to small order parameters and large effective correlation times.
\begin{figure}[!h]

\end{figure}



\section{Discussion and conclusions}
Protein rotational dynamics was separated to the overall
brownian tumbling around protein intertia axes and internal
conformational sampling. The overall rotational diffusion constants
were calculated from the slope of mean square angle deviations (Eq. \ref{DIFFdef}),
which were found to be essentially linear for all inertia axes.
The results indicate that monomeric proteins in dilute solution
experience rotational brownian tumbling in agreement with previous
MD simulation study \cite{wong08}. Only a small subdiffusive behaviour
was found with short timescales below 0.12 ns. This result can be used as a constrast
for crowded environment, where anomalous diffusion is expected to
be more significant \cite{hofling13}.

General form of rotational correlation function for anisotropic rigid body
(Eq.~\ref{CORRFanisot}) with timescales from rotational diffusion constants
was successfully fit to the overall rotational correlation functions from
MD simulations for all individual N-H bonds. Furthermore, the new correlation
functions calculated from Eq.~\ref{newCORRF} were in good agreement with
the total correlation functions calculated from original trajectories.
The results suggest that the intertia axes can be used to describe
the overall rotational diffusion as a good approximation and that
the assumption of separation of internal and overall rotational
relaxation (Eq.~\ref{CORRFsep}) is a good approximation for the studied
proteins, as observed previously also for other protein~\cite{wong08,allner15}.

Usage of the new correlation functions from Eq.~\ref{newCORRF} in
spin relaxation time calculations reduces the statistical fluctuations
with long lag times in correlation function calculation,
which allows the higher accuracy with less simulation data.
The essential reason is that the rotational diffusion constants
can be determined by fitting a single parameter (linear slope) which is
more robust than a direct fit of multiexponential correlation function
to MD simulation result. After determining
the diffusion constants and using Eq.~\ref{newCORRF},
the contribution from overall rotation do not have statistical
fluctuations in correlation functions used in spin relaxation time calculations.

Comparison to experimental results revealed that overall rotational diffusion
coefficients were overestimated by a factor of $\sim$3 in simulations with tip3p
water, in agreement with previous studies \cite{prompers02,wong08,anderson12}. Simulations
with tip4p and opc4 water models gave more realistic diffusion coefficients,
which overestimated diffusion only with factors $\sim$1-1.2.
The realistic overall rotational dynamics was determined by
scaling the diffusion coefficients to all directions post-simulationally by the
same constant factors such that the calculated $T_1/T_2$ was in optimal
agreement with experiments. Similar correction has been done previously
for proteins with isotropic rotational diffusion with single exponential rotational correlation
function \cite{showalter07a,showalter07b,maragakis08,gu14,allner15}.
Alternatively only order parameters are used in the comparison with
experiments~\cite{gu14,maragakis08,trbovic08,best04}.
Overall rotational diffusion is previously corrected for anisotropic
molecules by using isotropic reorientational eigenmode dynamics (iRED)~\cite{prompers02}
or quaternions~\cite{anderson12}. The advantage of these approaches is that
the separation between internal and overall rotational dynamics is not
required, thus they would be applicable also for intrinsically disoredered
proteins. However, the correction of overall rotational diffusion is based on
the assumption that incorrect diffusion arises from incorrect water viscosity.
Thus, a water model reproducing correct overall rotational diffusion is required to
compare intrinsically disordered molecule simulations to experimental
relaxation data.

%or correcting overall rotation by using quaternions \cite{anderson12} or
%fitting timescales to satisfy experiments \cite{prompers02} or
%These approaches are not, however, useful for anitropic proteins and order
%parameter comparison is not direct comparison between simulations and experiments in
%the case of freely rotating molecules. 

%, which resulted scaling factor of 1.2 for
%PsTonB simulation with tip4p and factor 2.9 for HpTonB with tip3p.
%The overstimated overall diffusion
%coefficient can be corrected post-simulationally to compare internal dynamics
%and order with experiments. 
%As already observed previously
%In addition, diffusion constants can be scaled with a constant
%factor before calculating the new correlation functions to compensate
%the overestimated rotational diffusion due to inaccuracies in some
%water models.

A good agreement between spin relaxation times from experiments and simulations is
found after overall rotational diffusion constants are scaled with a constant
factor. This allows the interpretation of internal protein dynamics
from spin relaxation times by using MD simulations even with tip3p water model.
Here we use the approach to indentify dynamical regions in two proteins,
HpTonB-92 and PsTonB with relatively rigid structures. However, the
approach could be useful for intepretation of spin relaxation data from
proteins with more regions containing complicated local dynamics, like
Calmodulin~\cite{barbato92}.
