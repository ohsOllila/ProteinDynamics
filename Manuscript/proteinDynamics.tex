  Conformational fluctuations and rotational tumbling of proteins can be experimentally accessed
  with nuclear spin relaxation experiments. Interpretation of molecular dynamics from the
  experimental data is, however, often complicated, especially for molecules with anisotropic
  shape. Here we apply classical molecular dynamics simulations to interpret conformational fluctuations
  and rotational tumbling of proteins with arbitrarily anisotropic shape. The direct calculation
  of spin relaxation times from simulation data did not reproduce the experimental data.
  This was successfully corrected by scaling the overall rotational diffusion constants around
  protein intertia axes with a constant factor. The achieved good agreement with experiments
  allowed the interpretation of internal and overall dynamics of proteins with significantly
  anisotropic shape. The overall rotational diffusion was found to be brownian, having only a
  short subdiffusive region below 0.12~ns. The presented methodology can be applied to
  interpret rotational dynamics and conformation fluctuations of proteins with arbitrary anisotropic
  shape. However, for intrinsically disordered proteins a water model with more realistic
  dynamical properties is probably required.

\section{Introduction}
Conformational fluctuations and the entropy of proteins
play a significant role in their functionality
and interactions with other biomolecules.
Conformational fluctuations and the overall brownian tumbling of proteins
are experimentally accessible through the 
spin relaxation times of $^{15}$N and $^{13}$C nucleai measured
with nuclaer magnetic resonance (NMR) 
techniques \cite{jarymowycz06,korzhnev01,mulder01,eisenmesser05,bedem15,lewandowski15,lamley15}. 
The spin relaxation rates have been used to, for example, analyze
conformational entropies \cite{yang96,kasinath13,allner15,jarymowycz06}, binding entropies \cite{akke93,jarymowycz06},
resolve sampled structures \cite{mulder01,eisenmesser05,bedem15,medina14}
and validate molecular dynamics simulations \cite{best04,showalter07a,showalter07b,maragakis08,trbovic08}.
These analyzes are almost exclusively based on the
separation of the internal conformational fluctuations 
and the overall rotational tumbling \cite{wennerstrom79,Lipari82}.
Also the isotropic overall diffusion is often assumed, while
analysis of anisotropic molecules is significantly more
complicated \cite{woessner62,shimizu62,jarymowycz06,korzhnev01,luginbuhl97,hall04}.
Thus, the new approaches are needed to intepret spin relaxation times
measured from anisotropic or intrinsically disordered molecules.

Classical molecular dynamics simulation methods are
promising tools to interpretate spin relaxation experiments
for molecules with significantly anisotropic shape or correlations between
internal and overall rotational motions. Practical applications
are, however, limited by inaccuracies in the force field descriptions
and the available time scales in the simulations \cite{prompers02,maragakis08,trbovic08,wong08,anderson12}.
The main issues have been the overestimated overall rotational diffusion of proteins
due to inaccuracies in water models~\cite{wong08} and the
insufficient accuracy of correlation functions calculated from
single molecules in MD simulations~\cite{lu06,anderson12}.

In this work we overcome these issues by assuming that the overall
rotational dynamics of protein follows anisotropic rigid body diffusion.
Diffusion coefficients around inertia axes are 
directly calculated from angular displacements.
The diffusion coefficients are then used to determine the
contribution of the overall rotational tumbling to the 
rotational correlation functions of N-H bonds.
This reduces the required simulation length for the accurate determination
of rotational correlation functions. Furthermore, the overestimated
overall brownian tumbling rates due to the inaccurate water model
can be corrected during the correlation function calculation by scaling
the diffusion coefficients in all directions with a constant factor.
The corrected correlation functions can be used to interpret the spin relaxation
experiments for proteins with arbitrarily anisotropic shapes.

The developed approach is demonstrated by interpreting the experimental spin relaxation data 
for C-terminal domains of TonB proteins from {\it H. pyroli} ({\it Hp}TonB)~\cite{ciragan16}
and from {\it Pseudomonas aeruginosa} ({\it Pa}TonB). Both proteins have significantly
anisotropic shape, which would complicate the standard spin relaxation data
analysis~\cite{woessner62,shimizu62,jarymowycz06,korzhnev01,luginbuhl97,hall04}.
%These protein segments are critical for iron transport into Helicbacteri
%Pyroli and Pseudomonas bacteria, respectively.


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Spin relaxation experiments and rotational dynamics of molecules}
Molecular dynamics of the protein backbone residues and spin relaxation experiments can
be connected by using the spectral density $J(\omega)$ 
\begin{equation}\label{SPECTdens}
  J(\omega)=2\int_0^\infty C(t) \cos(\omega t) {\rm d}t,
\end{equation}
which is the Fourier transformation of the second order
rotational correlation function for N-H bond vector
\begin{equation}\label{CORRFdef}
  C(t)=\langle \frac{3}{2}\cos^2\theta_{t'+t}-\frac{1}{2} \rangle_{t'},
\end{equation}
where $\theta_{t'+t}$ is the N-H bond angle between times $t'$ and $t'+t$
and angular brackets refer to the ensemble average.
Connection to the experimentally measured spin relaxation times $T_1$, $T_2$
and $T_{\rm NOE}$ is given by the Redfield equations \cite{abragam,kay89}
\begin{equation}\label{R1}
  \begin{aligned}
  \frac{1}{T_1}= & \frac{d_{\rm{NH}}^2N_{\rm{H}}}{20}\bigg[J(\omega_{\rm{H}}-\omega_{\rm{N}})+3J(\omega_{\rm{N}})+6J(\omega_{\rm{N}}+\omega_{\rm{H}})\bigg] \\
        & +\frac{(\sigma \omega_{\rm{N}})^2}{15}J(\omega_{\rm{N}}),
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{R2}
    \begin{aligned}
  \frac{1}{T_2}= & \frac{1}{2}\frac{d_{\rm{NH}}^2N_{\rm{H}}}{20}\bigg[4J(0)+3J(\omega_{\rm{N}})+J(\omega_{\rm{H}}-\omega_{\rm{N}})+6J(\omega_{\rm{H}})  \\
    & +6J(\omega_{\rm{N}}+\omega_{\rm{H}})\bigg]+\frac{(\sigma \omega_{\rm{N}})^2}{90}[4J(0) +3J(\omega_{\rm{N}})],
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{NOE}
  \frac{1}{T_{\rm NOE}}=1+\frac{d_{\rm{NH}}^2N_{\rm{H}}}{20}\bigg[6J(\omega_{\rm{N}}+\omega_{\rm{H}})+J(\omega_{\rm{H}}-\omega_{\rm{N}}))\bigg]\frac{\gamma_{\rm{H}}T_1}{\gamma_{\rm{N}}},
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{\rm{N}}$ and $\omega_{\rm{H}}$ are the Larmor angular
frequencies of $^{15}$N and $^1$H respectively, and
the number of bound protons $N_{\rm{H}}=1$ for N-H bonds.
The dipolar coupling constant is given by
\begin{equation}
d_{\rm{NH}}=-\frac{\mu_0\hbar\gamma_{\rm{H}}\gamma_{\rm{N}}}{4\pi\langle r_{\rm{NH}}^3\rangle},\nonumber
\end{equation}
where $\mu_0$ is the magnetic constant or vacuum permeability, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant,
$\gamma_{\rm{N}}$ and $\gamma_{\rm{H}}$ are the gyromagnetic constants of $^{15}$N and $^1$H, respectively.
The average cubic length is calculated as $\langle r_{\rm{NH}}^3\rangle = (0.101{\rm nm})^3$ and the 
value of $\Delta \sigma = -160$ ppm is used for the chemical shift anisotropy of N-H bonds in 
proteins \cite{kay89,hiyama88}.
%Same equations can be used, for example, to C-H bond by changing the
%constants related to nitrogen to the ones corresponding carbon. 

Spin relaxation experiments are typically interpreted for proteins by
assuming that the motions related to the overall brownian tumbling 
and conformational fluctuations are independent.
The rotational correlation function for chemical bonds can be then written
as  \cite{wennerstrom79,Lipari82,jarymowycz06,korzhnev01,halle09}
\begin{equation}\label{CORRFsep}
  C(t)=C_I(t)C_O(t),
\end{equation}
where $C_I(t)$ and $C_O(t)$ are correlation functions for internal and overall
rotations, respectively. Conformational fluctuations can be described
in this approximation by using the square of the order parameter respect to 
molecular axes $S^2$, which is given by the plateau of the internal rotational 
correlation function. Timescales for the fluctuations can be characterized by
using the effective correlation time 
\begin{equation}\label{effCT}
  \tau_{\rm eff}=\int_0^\infty C_I'(t) \mathrm{d}t,
\end{equation}
where $C_I'(t)=\frac{C_I-S^2}{1-S^2}$ is the reduced correlation function \cite{Lipari82}.

The overall rotational correlation function is often described
by approximating the protein as a rigid body.
For arbitrarily anisotropic molecules, the correlation functions
can  be presented as a sum of five exponentials~\cite{woessner62,korzhnev01}
\begin{equation}\label{CORRFanisot}
  C_O(t)=\sum_{j=1}^5 A_j e^{-t/\tau_j},
\end{equation}
where the time constants $\tau_j$ are related 
to the diffusion constants around
three principal axes of a molecule
($D_{xx}$, $D_{yy}$ and $D_{zz}$)  
\footnote{
$\tau_1=(4D_{xx}+D_{yy}+D_{zz})^{-1}$,
$\tau_2=(D_{xx}+4D_{yy}+D_{zz})^{-1}$,
$\tau_3=(D_{xx}+D_{yy}+4D_{zz})^{-1}$,
$\tau_4=[6(D+(D^2-L^2)^{-1/2}]^{-1}$,
$\tau_5=[6(D-(D^2-L^2)^{-1/2}]^{-1}$,
$D=\frac{1}{3}(D_{xx}+D_{yy}+D_{zz})$ and 
$L^2=\frac{1}{3}(D_{xx}D_{yy}+D_{xx}D_{zz}+D_{yy}D_{zz})$}
and the prefactors $A_j$ depend on the directions of chemical bonds 
respect to the molecular axes \cite{woessner62,luginbuhl97}.

The simplest approach to extract molecular dynamics from the experimental
data is the original ''model free analysis''~\cite{Lipari82},
where an isotropic diffusion is assumed for the overall rotation of the protein.
This reduces Eq.~\ref{CORRFanisot} to a monoexponential form and the overall rotational
dynamics can be described with a single time constant $\tau_c$.
Also the internal correlation functions for each residue are assumed
to decay exponentially with a single time constant $\tau_{\rm eff}$
toward to the square of the order parameter $S^2$. The three parameters
($\tau_c$, $\tau_{\rm eff}$ and $S^2$) can be then successfully resolved from a
fit to the experimental data.
However, the amount of parameters to be fitted increases if the protein
experiences an anisotropic overall diffusion or has several timescales for internal motions.
In this case the fitting becomes often ambiguous, even if the experimental data
would be measured with multiple magnetic field strengths~\cite{dosset00,luginbuhl97,jarymowycz06}.
The anitropic rotational diffusion is sometimes described with hydrodynamical
calculations, but they are quite sentitive for the assumptions about the
hydration shell of the protein~\cite{torre00}.

Rough estimate for the timescale of overall rotational dynamics 
is often given by using the $T_1/T_2$ ratio \cite{kay89}. 
This is based on the assumptions that $T_1$ and $T_2$
are essentially independent of the internal motions and that the overall
dynamics is isotropic. The spectral density then reduces to 
\begin{equation}
J'(\omega) = S^2\frac{\tau_c'}{1+(\omega \tau_c')^2} 
\end{equation}
and the correlation time describing the overall rotational motion, $\tau_c'$, can 
be then estimated by numerically minimizing the equation
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}\label{ratioEQ}
  \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx  \frac{\frac{1}{2}\frac{d_{\rm{NH}}^2N_{\rm{H}}}{20}\bigg[4J'(0)+3J'(\omega_{\rm{N}})+J'(\omega_{\rm{H}}-\omega_{\rm{N}})+6J'(\omega_{\rm{H}})  +6J'(\omega_{\rm{N}}+\omega_{\rm{H}})\bigg]+\frac{(\sigma \omega_{\rm{N}})^2}{90}[4J'(0) +3J'(\omega_{\rm{N}})]}{\frac{d_{\rm{NH}}^2N_{\rm{H}}}{20}\bigg[J'(\omega_{\rm{H}}-\omega_{\rm{N}})+3J'(\omega_{\rm{N}})+6J'(\omega_{\rm{N}}+\omega_{\rm{H}})\bigg] +\frac{(\sigma \omega_{\rm{N}})^2}{15}J'(\omega_{\rm{N}})}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
with respect to the experimentally measured $T_1/T_2$ ratio.

\subsection{Rotational dynamics from molecular dynamics simulations}\label{MDanalysis}
A classical molecular dynamics simulation gives a trajectory for each atom in
the system as a function of time. Rotational correlation functions for each bond
can be then directly calculated from the trajectories by using Eq. \ref{CORRFdef}
and used to calculate the spin relaxation times through Eqs. \ref{SPECTdens}-\ref{NOE}.
The resulting values can be compared to experimental data in order to assess simulation model
quality \cite{best04,showalter07a,showalter07b,maragakis08,trbovic08,fisette12} or
to interpret experiments~\cite{fisette12}.

The direct comparison with experiments is, however, often complicated by
insufficient statistics for the calculated correlation functions and the overestimated
rotational diffusion due to inaccuracies in water models~\cite{wong08,anderson12}.
Here we show that the statisitical accuracy of the contribution of the
overall tumbling to the correlation functions, $C_0(t)$ in Eq.~\ref{CORRFsep}, can be increased for
rigid proteins by directly calculating the diffusion coefficients for intertia axes.
The rotational diffusion coefficients can be related to timescales
in the correlation function for anisotropic rigid body rotation
in Eq. \ref{CORRFanisot}~\cite{woessner62,Note1}.

The rotational diffusion coefficients are calculated by fitting a linear slope to the 
square angle deviation of intertia axes (see below). This requires less simulation data
for the good statistics than a direct fit of multiexponential sum in Eq. \ref{CORRFanisot}
to the rotational correlation function calculated from MD simulation.
In addition, the overestimated rotational diffusion due to water model~\cite{wong08} can
be corrected by scaling the diffusion coefficients around all intertia axes
by a constant factor. This approach takes into account the anisotoropic shape of
the molecule. This is a significant advancement to the studies, which assume
isotropic rotational diffusion with a single exponential rotational correlation
function \cite{showalter07a,showalter07b,maragakis08,gu14,allner15} or
use order parameters to compare simulations with experimental data~\cite{gu14,maragakis08,trbovic08,best04}.


The practical analysis can be divided into seven steps: \\
1) The total rotational correlation functions $C(t)$
for the protein N-H bond vectors are directly calculated from MD simulation trajectory
by applying Eq.~\ref{CORRFdef}. \\
2) The rotational correlation functions for internal
dynamics $C_I(t)$ are calculated from MD simulation trajectory
by removing overall rotation of the protein. \\
3) The overall and internal motions are assumed to be independent and the overall
rotational correlation function is calculated from Eq. \ref{CORRFsep} as $C_O(t)=C(t)/C_I(t)$. \\
4) The mean square angle deviations of rotation around protein intertia axes
are calculated from MD simulation trajectory. \\
5) Rotational diffusion constants $D_x$, $D_y$ and $D_z$ are calculated by fitting a straight line
to the mean square angle deviations 
\begin{equation}\label{DIFFdef}
  \begin{aligned}
    \langle \Delta \alpha_{t'+t}^2 \rangle_{t'} = 2 D_{x} t \\
    \langle \Delta \beta_{t'+t}^2 \rangle_{t'} = 2 D_{y} t \\
    \langle \Delta \gamma_{t'+t}^2 \rangle_{t'} = 2 D_{z} t, \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\langle \Delta \alpha_{t'+t}^2 \rangle_{t'}$,
$\langle \Delta \beta_{t'+t}^2 \rangle_{t'}$ and
$\langle \Delta \gamma_{t'+t}^2 \rangle_{t'}$ are
the mean square angle deviations from the shortest protein
intertia axis to the longest, respectively.\\
6) Contribution of the overall rotational tumbling to all correlation
functions is assumed to follow Eq.~\ref{CORRFanisot} with
timescales $\tau_j$ calculated from the rotational diffusion constants~\cite{Note1}.
Weighting factors $A_j$ are determined by fitting the equation with new timescales
to the overall rotational correlation functions calculated from MD simulations in step 3. \\
7) The new correlation functions are calculated by substituting
internal correlation functions, $C_I(t)$, from step 2 and anisotropic rigid body
rotational correlation functions, $C_O(t)$, from step 6 to
Eq.~\ref{CORRFsep} giving
\begin{equation}\label{newCORRF}
  C_N(t)=C_I(t)\sum_{j=1}^5 A_j e^{-t/\tau_j}.
\end{equation}
These correlation functions are then used to calculate spin relaxation times
from Eqs. \ref{SPECTdens}-\ref{NOE}. The incorrect overall rotational
diffusion due to water model can be corrected at this point  by scaling the rotational diffusion
coefficients, i.e. timescales $\tau_j$, with a constant factor before calculating
new correlation functions from Eq. \ref{newCORRF}.

All simulations were ran using Gromacs 5 \cite{abraham15}
and Amber ff99SB- ILDN~\cite{lindorff10} force field for proteins . The proteins were solvated
to tip3p\cite{jorgensen83}, tip4p \cite{jorgensen83} or OPC4 \cite{izadi14} water models.
Initial structures were taken from NMR structures of {\it Hp}TonB \cite{ciragan16} and
{\it Pa}TonB \cite{??}.
The temperature was coupled to the desired value with v-rescale thermostat \cite{bussi07} and the pressure was 
isotropically set to 1 bar using Parrinello-Rahman barostat \cite{parrinello81}.
Timestep was 2~fs, Lennart-Jones interactions were cut-off at 1.0~nm,
PME~\cite{darden93,essman95} was used for electrostatics and LINCS was used
to constraint all bond lengths \cite{hess07}. Simulation trajectories and the related
files are available at \cite{??}. The simulated systems are listed
in Table \ref{ROTdiffCOEFFS}


The rotational correlation functions are calculated with {\it gmx rotacf} from
Gromacs package \cite{gromacsMANUAL}. The overall rotation was removed
for $C_I(t)$ calculation by using a fit option of the {\it gmx trjconv} tool
in Gromacs package \cite{gromacsMANUAL}. The order parameters $S^2$
were determined by averaging rotational correlation functions from
oriented trajectory, $C_I(t)$, over the lag times above 50~ns.
The effective correlation times were then calculated by using Eq.~\ref{effCT}. 
Inertia axes of proteins were calculated with {\it compute\_inertia\_tensor}
function from MDTraj python library~\cite{McGibbon2015MDTraj}.

Spectral density was calculated by fitting a
sum of 471 exponentials with timescales from 1 ps to 50 ns
with logarithmic spacing
\begin{equation}\label{gprime_fit}
C_N(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_i e^{-t/\tau_i}
\end{equation}
to the new correlation function from Eq.~\ref{newCORRF}
by using the {\it lsqnonneg} routine in MATLAB \cite{matlab}.
The Fourier transform was then calculated by using the analytical function
for the sum of exponentials 
\begin{equation}\label{FTanal}
J(\omega) =  4 \sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_i\frac{\tau_i}{1+\omega^2\tau_i^2}.
\end{equation}
A similar approach has been previously used for the lamellar lipid and surfactant
systems in combination with solid state NMR experiements \cite{nowacka13,ferreira15}.
All the computer programs used for the analysis are available at~\cite{??}.

\subsection{Spin relaxation experiments}
NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 850 NMR spectrometer equipped
with cryogenic probe head. The longitudinal ($T_1$), transverse ($T_2$), and
$^1$H-$^{15}$N-heteronuclear NOE ($T_{\rm NOE}$) spin relaxation times
for the backbone $^{15}$N atoms of {\it Hp}TonB~\cite{ciragan16}
were collected at 303~K using the well-established NMR pulse sequences described previously~\cite{kay89,barbato92}.
The similarly detected spin relaxation data for {\it Pa}TonB at 298~K is reported in a another publication~\cite{??}. 
The $T_1$ and $T_2$ relaxation times were measured using the following delay
times: 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1000, 1200 and 2000 ms,
and 16, 64, 96, 128, 156, 196, 224 and 256 ms for CPMG pulse train with 1.0 ms interval
for $T_2$ relaxation times, respectively. The relaxation rates ($R_1=1/T_1$, $R_2=1/T_2$)
were calculated as an exponential fit of a single exponential decay to peak intensity
values: $I(t) = I_0 \exp(-t/T_1)$, or $I(t)=I_0 \exp(-t/T_2)$,
where $I(t)$ is the peak volume at a time $t$. The $^{15}$N$ \{ ^1$H$ \} $-NOE measurements were carried out
with a relaxation delay of 5~s with and without saturation of the amide protons.
The $^{15}$N$ \{ ^1$H$ \} $-NOE values were derived from the volumes of the HSQC peaks using the
equation of $\nu=I/I_0$. The relaxation data was processed and analysed using
Bruker Dynamic Center software (version 2.1.8).

\section{Results}

\subsection{Global rotational dynamics of protein}

The mean square angle deviations for the rotation of {\it Pa}TonB protein construct
around inertia axes in the simulation with OPC4 water model
are shown in Fig. \ref{RMASDplot}. This is the longest
simulation data set in this work (1.2$\mu$s) and the
linear behaviour of the mean square angle deviations are observed
for the lag times up to one hundreth of the total simulation length (12~ns),
which is expected to be the maximum lag time for the good statistics
of rotational dynamics analyzed from a single molecule in MD simulations~\cite{lu06}.
Deviations from the linear behaviour are only seen with the lag times longer
than this limit, as also demonstrated for the shorter simulations in
Figs.~\ref{RMASDplotLOG310}~and~\ref{RMASDplotLOG298} with tip4p water at
two different temperatures. The plots with log-log scale in
Figs.~\ref{RMASDplot},~\ref{RMASDplotLOG310}~and~\ref{RMASDplotLOG298} B)
reveals a weakly subdiffusive region only below very short timescales
of approximately~0.12~ns. Thus, we conclude that the protein
experiences the brownian rotational tumbling with  a good approximation.
The diffusion coefficients can be then calculated from the slope of the mean square angle
deviations according to Eq. \ref{DIFFdef} by using the lag times less than
one hundreth of the total MD simulation length.
The error bars were calculated varying the lag time with 1~ns to both directions.
The data from {\it Hp}TonB protein (not shown) led to similar conclusions.

\end{figure}

The resulting rotational diffusion constants from different simulations are
shown in Table \ref{ROTdiffCOEFFS}.
As expected, the rotational diffusion coefficients
increase with the temperature and the decreasing size of a protein.
The values are, however, larger than would be  
expected from the experimental $T_2/T_1$ ratio analysed with Eq. \ref{ratioEQ}
and from the previosly reported values for proteins with similar
sizes~\cite{krishnan98}, especially when tip3p water model is used.
Similar results were previously explained by the overestimated water
self-diffusion of tip3p water model~\cite{wong08}.

The analysis leading to the new correlation functions in Eq.~\ref{newCORRF}
(see section~\ref{MDanalysis}) is exemplified in
Fig.~\ref{exampleCORRF} for three residues locating in different domains of {\it Pa}TonB
protein with different characteristic rotational dynamics.
The flexible C-terminus is represented by the residue 341,
more rigid $\beta$-sheet by the residue 331 and a
flexible loop between two sheets by the residue 322. 
The total correlation functions $C(t)$
of all the residues in Fig.~\ref{exampleCORRF}  (top, solid lines). 
decay toward zero within~$\sim$10-50~ns.
The internal correlation functions $C_I(t)$ in Fig.~\ref{exampleCORRF} (middle)
decay to a plateau value, which defines the square of the order parameter $S^2$.
As expected, the internal correlation function for the residue 331 in the
rigid $\beta$-sheet rapidly decays to the largest order parameter value,
while the correlation functions of the residues in the loop and C-terminus 
decay slower to the smaller order parameter values due to the larger conformational ensemble
sampled by these regions.

    }\label{exampleCORRF}
\end{figure}

The overall rotational correlation functions, $C_O(t)=C(t)/C_I(t)$,
are shown in Fig.~\ref{exampleCORRF} (bottom, solid lines).
Also the correlation functions of anisotropic rigid body rotation
from Eq. \ref{CORRFanisot} are shown in Fig. \ref{exampleCORRF} (bottom, dashed lines).
The timescales for the latter, $\tau_i$, are given by the rotational
diffusion coefficients from the simulation and the relation
in Ref.~\citenum{Note1}, and the prefactors, $A_j$, are determined by fitting
Eq.~\ref{CORRFanisot} to the overall rotation correlation functions, $C_O(t)$, calculated the MD simulation.
The new correlation functions, determined from Eq. \ref{newCORRF} and
shown in Fig. \ref{exampleCORRF} (top, dashed lines),
are indistinguishable from the correlation functions calculated from
the original MD simulations with the lag times shorter than one
hundredth of total simulation time (approximately 4-12~ns for the studied systems),
which is the expected limit for the good statistics in single molecule MD simulations \cite{lu06}.
This suggests that the anisotropic rigid body diffusion model (Eq. \ref{CORRFanisot}) and
the separation of internal and global motions (Eq. \ref{CORRFsep}) are
good approximations for the studied system.
The analytical description of the overall rotation with Eq. \ref{CORRFanisot}
in the new correlation functions
clearly reduces the statistical fluctuations with the long lag times in Fig. \ref{exampleCORRF}.
The effect is most visible for the flexible C-terminus (residue 341) having
the smallest, thus the least detectable, contribution from the
overall rotation of the protein due to the small order parameters values.

\subsection{Global rotational dynamics in simulations and experiments}
%Spin relaxation times from MD simulations and NMR experiments \cite{??} are compared
%in Figs. \ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATA} and \ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATA}
%for {\it Hp}TonB-92 and PsTonBsystems, respectivelty. 
%Rotational correlation functions from simulations were determined by using
%Eq. \ref{newCORRF}, where internal correlation functions were taken from
%MD simulations, timescales were determined from protein overall rotation
%diffusion constants and prefactors from the fit to the MD simulation data,
%as decribed in previous section. The correlation functions were used to calculate
%spectral densities from Eqs.~\ref{gprime_fit}-\ref{FTanal} and
%spin relaxation times were then calculated from Eqs.~\ref{R1}-\ref{NOE}.

The spin relaxation times of the {\it Hp}TonB construct are compared 
between the experiments and simulations using two
different water models in Fig.~\ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATA}.
Simulations with tip3p water model are significantly
off from the experimental data and underestimate the $T_1/T_2$ ratio, suggesting too
fast overall rotational diffusion dynamics \cite{carper97}.
This is in agreement with the previous study, where the overestimated
rotational diffusion was attributed to the self-diffusion of tip3p~\cite{wong08}.
On the other hand, simulation results with tip4p water model show signifigantly
better agreement with the experimental data in  Fig.~\ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATA}.
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{../Figs/HpTonBrelaxationDATA.eps}%
  \caption{$^{15}$N Spin relaxation times for {\it Hp}TonB from experimental data (circles)
    and MD simulations with different water models (squares).
    \label{HpTonBrelaxationDATA}}%
\end{figure}

To see if the discrepancy in spin relaxation times for simulations with tip3p water model
could be explained by the overestimated overall diffusion of the protein,
the diffusion coefficients were divided with a constant factor of 2.9 before applying
Eq. \ref{newCORRF} to calculate the new correlation functions. The spin
relaxation times calculated from the new correlation functions after scaling
the rotational diffusion coefficients are, indeed, in good agreement with
the experimental data in Fig.~\ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATAscaled}
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{../Figs/RELdataHpTonB2.eps}%

    \label{HpTonBrelaxationDATAscaled}}%
\end{figure}

Similar comparison for the spin relaxation times of the {\it Pa}TonB construct
between experiments and simulations with tip4p and OPC4 water models
is shown in Fig. \ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATA}.
The experimentation of the OPC4 water model was inspired by the
recent study reporting significant improvements in lipid monolayer
simulations when this water model was used~\cite{javanainen17}. 
Since tip3p water model was observed to significantly overestimate the
rotational diffusion of protein, it was not used in {\it Pa}TonB
simulations. The underestimation of $T_1/T_2$ ratio was 
also observed in simulations of {\it Pa}TonB with
tip4p and OPC4 water models when compared with experiments.
The discrepancy is, however, less severe than for {\it Hp}TonB simulated
with tip3p in Fig.~\ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATA}, suggesting that also
the required correction for the overall rotational diffusion should
be smaller. Indeed,
the spin relaxation times calculated
from {\it Pa}TonB simulation with tip4p water model
were in good agreement with experiments in Fig.~\ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATAscaled}
after the diffusion coefficients were divided with a constant factor of 1.2,
which is smaller than 2.9 used for {\it Hp}TonB simulation above.
Notably, the temperature difference of 12 degrees has significantly 
smaller effect on spin relaxation times than the scaling of the diffusion 
coefficient or the differences between simulations and experiments.

\end{figure}

The correction of the overall rotational diffusion coefficients
with a constant factor led to a good agreement with experimental
spin relaxation data for both studied proteins simulated with different water models,
as seen in Figs.~\ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATAscaled} and~\ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATAscaled}.
The good agreement with experiments suggests that the scaled rotational diffusion coefficients
from MD simulations can be considered as a interpretation of the anisotropic rotational motion in NMR experiments.
The scaled rotational diffusion coefficients from simulations giving the best agreement
with the experimental data are collected in Table \ref{ROTdiffCOEFFSscaled}.
%The scaled diffusion coefficients
%from tip3p simulations were chosen for {\it Hp}TonB-92, because they give
%slightly better overall agreement with experiments than simulations with
%tip4p water model.
In contrast to the unscaled diffusion constants in Table~\ref{ROTdiffCOEFFS},
these results are in line with the previously reported values for proteins
with similar sizes~\cite{krishnan98}. Also the timescales, $\tau_{c}'$, estimated from 
Eq. \ref{ratioEQ} are close to the average diffusion coefficient, $\tau_{c}=(6D_{av})^{-1}$,
in Table~\ref{ROTdiffCOEFFS}.

\subsection{Interpretation of protein internal relaxation from MD simulations}
The good agreement of the spin relaxation times between simulations
with the scaled overall rotational diffusion coefficients and
experiments (Figs. \ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATAscaled} and \ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATAscaled})
suggest that the simulations can be used to interpret the internal
dynamics of proteins from the experimental data.

Only small variations between different residues are observed
for spin relaxation times of {\it Hp}TonB construct in Fig. \ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATA}.
This indicates a rather rigid protein structure, which is also seen in
MD simulation snapshots overlayed in Fig. \ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATA} A).
Only few residues in the terminal ends show slightly
enhanced conformational fluctuations in the MD simulation and in
spin relaxation data. In addition, some deviations from the average spin relaxation times
are observed in the experiemental data close to the residues 210-222, where  
difficulties in the peak assignment was also observed~\cite{ciragan16}.
Simulations of {\it Hp}TonB construct do not offer any explanation for this
observation, however, similar region in {\it Pa}TonB simulation shows 
fluctuations between two orientations of $\alpha$-helix (see discussion below).
Exceptionally low order parameters and long effective correlation times 
are observed in simulations for the residues 245-250 of {\it Hp}TonB.
Also small $T_1$ times are experimentally observed close to this region,
but the interpretation is not straightforward as the low $T_1$ values 
are not reproduced by MD simulations.
%More detailed discussion together with
%longer {\it Hp}TonB construct is presented elsewhere \cite{??}.

More variety in the internal dynamics between residues is observed for {\it Pa}TonB
protein and the segments with enhanced conformational fluctuations are labelled with yellow colour
in Fig. \ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATAscaled}.
Larger number of sampled conformations in both terminal ends
%show significantly enhanced conformational fluctuations
%in MD simulations and in spin relaxation experiments. The terminal ends
are characterized by low order parameters and long effective internal correlation times
observed in simulations. 
Enhanced conformational fluctuations are also observed for residues between 320-326,
which correspond the loop between two $\beta$-sheets.
MD simulations predict low order parameters and long internal effective correlation
times also for residues between 260-274, which can be explained by  
two different orientations sampled by the $\alpha$-helix in this region
(colour labelled with pink in Fig.~\ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATAscaled} A).
The orientational fluctuations of the similar short helix could also explain the above mentioned
lower spectral resolution and deviations of spin relaxation times
for residues 210-222 of {\it Hp}TonB~\cite{ciragan16}.

MD simulations can be used to suggest how the rotational dynamics of the individual N-H bonds
builds up from different components. In this work we have fitted a sum of 471 different
timescales to the correlation functions according to Eq.~\ref{gprime_fit}.
Most of the prefactor values are zero in all the correlation functions,
thus the remaining timescales with non-zero prefactors are considered as the different
components of the total relaxation process.
The prefactors are shown in Fig. \ref{coeffsPLOT} for the same residues
of {\it Pa}TonB, which were used to exemplify the correlation functions in Fig. \ref{exampleCORRF}.
As expected for the residue 322 in the rigid $\beta$-sheet with large order parameter value,
the rotational relaxation is dominated by timescales of $\sim$5.5~ns and $\sim$8~ns,
matching with the protein overall
rotation. Also the dynamics of the residue 322 in the flexible loop is
dominated by the timescales around $\sim$8~ns corresponding to the protein overall rotation,
however, the fast motions from internal dynamics are more significant than for the
rigid $\beta$-sheet residue. This is in agreement with lower order parameter value
in the flexible loop residues. On the other hand, the rotational dynamics of
the residue 341 in the flexible N-terminus is dominated by timescales
below 3~ns, most likely related to the internal dynamics of the protein.
Contributions from timescales around $\sim$13~ns to the dynamics of the residue 341 probably
arise from the slow conformational fluctuations of the N-terminus, rather than the overall
rotational dynamics. This supports the conclusion that the large amount of sampled
conformations lead to the small order parameters and large effective correlation times
observed in Fig. \ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATA}.
While fractionalization of the rotational dynamics to different components
gives intuitively understandable results, it should be kept in mind that
this is based on the fitting of a multiexponential sum to the simulation data and the solution
of such fit is not unique.

    a good agreement with experimental spin relaxation times as shown in
    Fig.~\ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATAscaled}.  \label{coeffsPLOT}}%

\section{Discussion and conclusions}
The experimental spin relaxation data for the protein backbone N-H bonds
was successfully reproduced by using the classical molecular dynamics
simulations for two different proteins.
Thus, the simulation trajectories give an atomic resolution
interpretation for the protein dynamics measured with NMR experiments.
Interpretation of the overall and internal dynamics was demonstrated for
two proteins with anisotropic molecular shape and some flexible domains. 
Interpretation of the spin relaxation data measured from
such proteins has been very challenging with the previously available
methods~\cite{barbato92,luginbuhl97}.

The overall rotation of the studied proteins was found to be brownian having
only a small subdiffusive behaviour with short timescales
below~$\sim$0.12 ns, which could be constrasted with crowded environments,
where anomalous diffusion is expected to be more significant \cite{hofling13}.
The direct analysis of classical molecular dynamics trajectories did not, however,
reproduce the experimental spin relaxation data. Comparison between the rotational 
diffusion coefficients and spin relaxation times between simulations and 
and experiments suggested that
the overall brownian tumbling of proteins is too rapid in simulations,
in agreement with the previous study suggesting that the discrepance arises
from the inaccuracies in water models~\cite{wong08}.
Scaling down the anisotropic diffusion coefficients in simulation data
led to the good agreement with experiments.

%which were found to be essentially linear for all inertia axes.
%The results indicate that monomeric proteins in dilute solution
%experience rotational brownian tumbling 

The overall rotational diffusion coefficients were overestimated by a factor of $\sim$3 in
{\it Hp}TonB simulations with tip3p water model, in agreement with previous
studies \cite{prompers02,wong08,anderson12}. Simulations with tip4p and opc4
water models gave the spin relaxation times in reasonable agreement with experiments
with scaling factors of $\sim$1-1.2, which is significantly less than for tip3p.
It should be noted, however, that the correct scaling factors for 
the two different proteins, {\it Hp}TonB and {\it Pa}TonB, simulated with the
same water model, tip4p, seems to be 1 and 1.2, respectively. This suggests
that the correction factor is not fully determined by the bulk water properties
and that the the hydration layer and water-protein interactions play a significant
role in rotational dynamics of proteins, as also suggested by the hydrodynamical 
calculations \cite{torre00}.



Similarity between the correlation functions from the original MD trajectory and
the new correlation functions from Eq.~\ref{newCORRF} 
suggest that the usage of the intertia axes
and the separation of internal and the overall rotational motions
(Eq.~\ref{CORRFsep}) are good approximations for the investigated
proteins, which is in agreement with previous studies of similar 
proteins~\cite{wong08,allner15}. However, it remains to be seen
how well this and other related approaches~\cite{prompers02,anderson12} 
will succeed for intrinsically disordered proteins without
the well defined shape. Since the correction of the incorrect overall
rotational diffusion due to water model may become higly complicated for such proteins,
it may be necessary to employ a water model giving correct
overall rotational diffusion coefficients for biomolecules.

%or correcting overall rotation by using quaternions \cite{anderson12} or
%fitting timescales to satisfy experiments \cite{prompers02} or
%These approaches are not, however, useful for anitropic proteins and order
%parameter comparison is not direct comparison between simulations and experiments in
%the case of freely rotating molecules. 

%A good agreement between spin relaxation times from experiments and simulations is
%found after overall rotational diffusion constants are scaled with a constant
%factor. This allows the interpretation of internal protein dynamics
%from spin relaxation times by using MD simulations even with tip3p water model.
%Here we use the approach to indentify dynamical regions in two proteins,
%{\it Hp}TonB-92 and {\it Pa}TonB with relatively rigid structures. However, the
%approach could be useful for intepretation of spin relaxation data from
%proteins with more regions containing complicated local dynamics, like
%Calmodulin~\cite{barbato92}.
