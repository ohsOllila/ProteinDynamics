\section{Introduction}
Spin relaxation rates measured with NMR techniques give segmental resolution
information about rotational dynamics of proteins and macromolecules.
Various models have been used to separate internal dynamics and order from
overall rotational diffusion of molecules \cite{??}.
These techniques have been highly useful in characterization of 
rotational diffusion and internal flexibility of proteins and other biomolecules.
On the other hand, segmental level information has been used in validation
and improvement of molecular dynamics simulation force fields \cite{??}.
Segmental order has been also related to conformational entropy of proteins \cite{??}.

Spin relaxation rates are typically intepreted by using various dynamical models
assuming different level of complexity of rotational relaxation processes.
The most simplistic models assume single timescale and order parameter for internal
motion and isotropic overall rotational diffusion. However, biomolecules often experience
anisotropic overall diffusion and several internal timescales. Models for more complicated
models have been also introduced, however, there are more fitting parameters in these models
and intepretation of experiments becomes extensively difficult.

Classical molecular dynamics simuations contain, in principle, all the complexity of the
timescales and could be used to interpret the rotational dynamics measured with spin
relaxation experiments. However, this has not been a trivial task due to the force field
issues and limited available time scales in the simulations.

In this work we present approach that can be used to analyze spin relaxation experiments
by using classical molecular dynamics simulations. The approach can be used for anisotropic
molecules and allows a correction of anisotropic overall diffusion. We demonstrate
the usage of the approach for two aniotropic protein constructs from engineered from
Helicobacteri pyroli and Pseudomonas.


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Spin relaxation and rotational dynamics of molecules}

Spin relaxation rates $R_1$, $R_2$ and $R_{\rm NOE}$ measured from NMR experiments
for N-H bondsare related to the molecular dynamics through spectral density $J(\omega)$ and equations \cite{abragam,kay89}
\begin{equation}\label{R1}
  \begin{aligned}
  R_{1}= & \frac{d_{\rm{NH}}^2N_{\rm{H}}}{20}\bigg[J(\omega_{\rm{H}}-\omega_{\rm{N}})+3J(\omega_{\rm{N}})+6J(\omega_{\rm{N}}+\omega_{\rm{H}})\bigg] \\
        & +\frac{(\sigma \omega_{\rm{N}})^2}{15}j(\omega_{\rm{N}}),
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{R2}
    \begin{aligned}
  R_{2}= & \frac{1}{2}\frac{d_{\rm{NH}}^2N_{\rm{H}}}{20}\bigg[4J(0)+3j(\omega_{\rm{N}})+J(\omega_{\rm{H}}-\omega_{\rm{N}})+6J(\omega_{\rm{H}})  \\
    & +6J(\omega_{\rm{N}}+\omega_{\rm{H}})\bigg]+\frac{(\sigma \omega_{\rm{N}})^2}{15*6}[4J(0) +3J(\omega_{\rm{N}})],
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{NOE}
R_{\rm NOE}=1+\frac{d_{\rm{NH}}^2N_{\rm{H}}}{20}\bigg[6J(\omega_{\rm{N}}+\omega_{\rm{H}})+J(\omega_{\rm{H}}-\omega_{\rm{N}}))\bigg]\frac{\gamma_{\rm{H}}}{\gamma_{\rm{N}}R_1},
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{\rm{N}}$ and $\omega_{\rm{H}}$ are the Larmor angular frequencies of $^{15}$N and $^1$H respectively,
$N_{\rm{H}}$ is the number of bound protons. The dipolar coupling constant is given by
\begin{equation}
d_{\rm{NH}}=-\frac{\mu_0\hbar\gamma_{\rm{H}}\gamma_{\rm{N}}}{4\pi\langle r_{\rm{CN}}^3\rangle},\nonumber
\end{equation}
where $\mu_0$ is the magnetic constant or vacuum permeability, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant,
$\gamma_{\rm{N}}$ and $\gamma_{\rm{H}}$ are the gyromagnetic constants of $^{15}$N and $^1$H, respectively.
Average cubic length is $\langle r_{\rm{CN}}^3\rangle \approx$ and the 
chemical shift anisotropy is $\Delta \sigma \approx 160*10^{-6}$ for N-H bonds in proteins \cite{??}.

Spectral density $J(\omega)$ is the Fourier transformation of the second order
rotational correlation function for N-H bond
\begin{equation}\label{SPECTdens}
  J(\omega)=2\int_0^\infty C(t) \cos(\omega t) {\rm d}t.
\end{equation}
The second order rotational correlation is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{CORRFdef}
  C(t)=\langle (3\cos^2\theta_{t';t'+t}-1)/2 \rangle_{t'},
\end{equation}
where average is ensemble average and $\theta$ is the angle between N-H bonds at times $t'$ and $t'+t$.
The rotational correlation function for protein tumbling in solution
contains information about overall rotation of the molecule as well as
internal relaxation processes. Assuming that these are independent,
the rotational correlation function can be written as \cite{??}
\begin{equation}\label{CORRFsep}
  C(t)=C_I(t)C_O(t),
\end{equation}
where $C_I(t)$ and $C_O(t)$ are correlation functions for internal and overall
rotiations, respectively. Correlation function for fully anisotropic overall
rotation can be written as a sum of five exponentials \cite{??}
\begin{equation}\label{CORRFanisot}
  C_O(t)=\sum_{j=1}^5 A_j e^{-t/\tau_j},
\end{equation}
where time constants $\tau_j$ are related \footnote{
$\tau_1=(4D_{xx}+D_{yy}+D_{zz})^{-1}$,
$\tau_2=(D_{xx}+4D_{yy}+D_{zz})^{-1}$,
$\tau_3=(D_{xx}+D_{yy}+4D_{zz})^{-1}$,
$\tau_4=[6(D+(D^2-L^2)^{-1/2}]^{-1}$,
$\tau_5=[6(D-(D^2-L^2)^{-1/2}]^{-1}$,
$D=\frac{1}{3}(D_{xx}+D_{yy}+D_{zz})$ and 
$L^2=\frac{1}{3}(D_{xx}D_{yy}+D_{xx}D_{zz}+D_{yy}D_{zz})$} to
the diffusion constants around
three principal axes of a molecule
$D_{xx}$, $D_{yy}$ and $D_{zz}$,  
defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{DIFFdef}
  \begin{aligned}
    \langle (\Delta \alpha_{t';t'+t})^2 \rangle_{t'} = 2 D_{xx} t \\
    \langle (\Delta \beta_{t';t'+t})^2 \rangle_{t'} = 2 D_{yy} t \\
    \langle (\Delta \gamma_{t';t'+t})^2 \rangle_{t'} = 2 D_{zz} t, \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\langle (\Delta \alpha_{t';t'+t})^2 \rangle_{t'}$,
$\langle (\Delta \beta_{t';t'+t})^2 \rangle_{t'}$ and
$\langle (\Delta \gamma_{t';t'+t})^2 \rangle_{t'}$ are mean
square angle deviations of protein intertia axes.
%\begin{equation}
%  C'_I(t)= e^{-t/\tau_c},
%\end{equation}
The internal correlation function decays to a plateau, which
defines the square of order parameter respect to molecular axes $S^2$.
The effective internal correlation time can be defined with the
help of reduced correlation function $C_I'(t)=(C_I-S^2)/(1-S^2)$ \cite{??}
\begin{equation}
  \tau_{\rm eff}=\int_0^\infty C_I'(t) \mathrm{d}t.
\end{equation}

Standard analyses of experimental relaxation data usually assume
fully or axially isotropic overall rotational motion and single
decay constant for interal motion. Then the free parameters
($S^2$, $\tau_j$, $A_j$) are fit against spin relaxation data
from experiments. This gives most likely very good results for
isotropic molecules for which the assumption of single internal
motional timescale is reasonable. However, for molecules with
significant shape anisotropy or several timescales in internal
motions the amoount parameters to be fitted becomes large compared
with the typical amount of experimental points.

\subsection{Rotational dynamics from molecular dynamics simulations}\label{MDanalysis}
Classical molecular dynamics simulations give trajectories of individual
atoms as a function of time, which can be used to calculate rotational
correlation functions for each bond and explicit separation of internal
and overall rotational motions of molecules. The rotational
correlation functions can be used to calculate spin relaxation times
through Eqs. \ref{R1}-\ref{SPECTdens}, which can be then compared to the
experimental data in order to assess simulation model quality \cite{??} and interpret
experiments \cite{??}. However, the comparison is often complicated by
the short simulation times \cite{??} and incorrect overall rotational
diffusion due to water models \cite{??}. These issues have been typically
overcame by introducing isotropic rotational diffusion term in the correlation
functions \cite{??} or comparing order parameters instead of spin relaxation rates \cite{??}.
These approaches are not, however, useful for anitropic proteins and order
parameter comparison is not direct comparison between simulations and experiments in
the case of freely rotating molecules. 

Method presented here can be applied also to anisotropic proteins simulated
with timescales routinely accessible with state of the art computational
infrastructure. The key idea of the method is to calculate the rotational
diffusion constants and then use Eq. \ref{CORRFanisot} to determine the
correlation function related to the overall rotational diffusion. 

Here we present method to analyse rotational dynamics,
The analysis of rotational dynamics permormed in this work can be
divided in essentially six steps listed here. \\
1) Total rotational correlation functions $C(t)$
for protein N-H bonds are calculated from MD simulation trajectory
by applying Eq.~\ref{CORRFdef}. \\
2) Rotational correlation functions for internal
dynamics $C_I(t)$ are calculated from a trajectory from where the overall
rotation of protein is removed. \\
3) The overall and internal motions are assumed to be independent and overall
rotational correlation function is calculated as $C_O(t)=C(t)/C_I(t)$ according to Eq. \ref{CORRFsep}. \\
4) The protein axes of inertia and their mean square deviations as function of
time are calculated from MD simulation trajectory. \\
5) Rotational diffusion constants $D_x$, $D_y$ and $D_z$ are calculated by fitting a straight line
to mean square angle deviations of inertia axes according to Eq.~\ref{DIFFdef}. \\
6) Timescales in Eq.~\ref{CORRFanisot} are calculated from diffusion constants and
weighting factors $A_j$ are determined by fitting the equation to
rotational correlation functions of overall rotational motion $C_0(t)$ determined in step 3). \\
7) New total rotational correlation functions $C_N(t)$ are determined by multiplying
internal correlation function $C_I(t)$ from step 2) by Eq. \ref{CORRFanisot} with
parameters from step 6). Rotational diffusion constants (and $\tau_i$ values in Eq. \ref{CORRFanisot})
can be also divided by a scaling factor at this point to tune overall
rotational diffusion in rotational dynamics model close to experimental value.



\subsection{Simulation and analysis details}
Simulations were ran using Gromacs 5 \cite{abraham15} And Amber ff99SB- ILDN~\cite{lindorff10}
force field for proteins . The proteins were solvated
to tip3p\cite{jorgensen83}, tip4p \cite{jorgensen83} or OPC4 \cite{izadi14} water models.
NMR structures from \cite{??} and \cite{ciragan16} are used as initial structure for 
PaTonB and HpTonB-92, respectively.
Temperature was coupled to desired value with v-rescale thermistat \cite{bussi07} and pressure was 
isotropically set to 1 bar using Parrinello-Rahman barostat \cite{parrinello81}.
Timestep was 2~fs, Lennart-Jones interactions were cut-off at 1.0~nm,
PME~\cite{darden93,essman95} was used for electrostatics and LINCS was used
to constraint all bond lengths \cite{hess07}. Simulation trajectory and related
files are available at [??].
The simulated systems are listed
in Table \ref{ROTdiffCOEFFS}

The rotation is removed by using fit option in {\it gmx trjconv} and rotational
correlation functions are calculated with {\it gmx rotacf} \cite{gromacsMANUAL}.
Intertia axes of protein are calculated with {\it compute\_inertia\_tensor} from
MDTraj python library~\cite{McGibbon2015MDTraj}.
The spectral density was calculated by first fitting the sum of 471 exponentials
having correlation times from 1 ps and 50 ns with logarithmic spacing to the new
correlation function 
\begin{equation}\label{gprime_fit}
C_N(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_i e^{-t/\tau_i},
\end{equation}
by using the {\it lsqnonneg} routine in MATLAB \cite{matlab}.
The Fourier transform is then calculated by using analytical function
for the sum of exponentials 
\begin{equation}\label{FTanal}
J(\omega) =  4 \sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_i\frac{\tau_i}{1+\omega^2\tau_i^2}.
\end{equation}
Similar approach is used previously for lamellar systems in combination
with solid state NMR experiements \cite{nowacka13,ferreira15}.

\section{Results and discussion}

\subsection{Global rotational dynamics of protein}
Mean square angle deviations of protein intertia axes as a function of time
from PsTonB simulations are shown in Fig. \ref{RMASDplot}.
Diffusion coefficients are calculated from linear fits by taking into
account lag times less than hundredth of the total simulation length,
which is expected to give good statistics for rotation of single molecules
in MD simulations \cite{??}. Linear diffusion fit to mean square angle
displacement seems farily good in Fig.~\ref{RMASDplot}, however,
log-log plot shown in \ref{RMASDplotLOG} reveals some anomalous
diffusion behaviour at time scales below 0.12~ns. Here we use diffusion
coeffiecents to include protein overall motion in spin relaxation
calculations and the effect of small anymaly with short timescales
is beyond the scope of the work. 
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{../Figs/RMASDplot.eps}%
  \caption{The intertia tensor angles as a function of time and mean square angular
    deviations for PsTonB simulation with OPC water model.
    \label{RMASDplot}}%
\end{figure}

The results for diffusion constants
from different simulations shown in Table \ref{ROTdiffCOEFFS}
are in line with previous results from experiments \cite{??} and
simulations \cite{??} for more isotropic proteins. As expected,
rotational diffusion is faster in simulations with higher temperature
or smaller protein. Also the larger diffusion constants for simulations
with tip3p are expected due to the low viscosity of the model \cite{??}.

Inclusion of rotational diffusion coefficients in N-H bond
rotational correlation functions is exemplified in in Fig.~\ref{exampleCORRF}
for residue 331 located in alpha helix of PaTonB protein. 
The same analysis is performed also to other bonds and the resulting
correlation functions are used to calculate spin relaxation rates.
As expected, the N-H bond correlation functions calculated from original MD trajectories
shown in Fig.~\ref{exampleCORRF} A)  decay to fluctuate approximately around zero
after $\sim$20ns. Fluctuations from
ideal relaxation behaviour begin already close to one
hundredth of total simulation time (approximately 4-12ns for the studied systems),
which is expected to be the limit for good
statistic for rotational dynamics analyzed from single molecule MD simulation \cite{??}.
Internal correlation functions, calculated from trajectory with overall protein rotation removed,
in Fig.~\ref{exampleCORRF} B) show rapid decay to a plateau value, which defines the square of the order
parameter $S^2$. The global rotational correlation functions calculated as $C_O(t)=C(t)/C_I(t)$
are shown in Fig.~\ref{exampleCORRF} C). 
\begin{figure}[!h]

\end{figure}

Overall rotational correlation functions were fit to Eq.  \ref{CORRFanisot}, where
timescales for anisotropic rotation~\cite{Note1} were determined by using rotational diffusion constants
from Table \ref{ROTdiffCOEFFS}, to determine the prefactors $A_j$ for all residues.
Resulst for such fit are exemplified with dashed lines in Fig. \ref{exampleCORRF} C) for residue 331 of PsTonB.
The prefactors, global rotational timescales and correlation functions for internal relaxation
were used to determine new correlation function $C_N(t)=C_I(t)\sum_{j=1}^5 A_j e^{-t/\tau_j}$,
where internal correlation comes directly from MD simulation and global rotational correlation
function from diffusion coefficients calculated from MD and Eq. \ref{CORRFanisot}. The new correlation
functions are exemplified with dashed lines in Fig. \ref{exampleCORRF} A) for residue 331 of PsTonB.

\subsection{Global rotational dynamics in simulations and experiments}
Spin relaxation rates were calculated from MD simulations by using new correlation
functions, where global rotational dynamics is described by Eq. \ref{CORRFanisot}
with timescales from diffusion constants in Table \ref{ROTdiffCOEFFS} and prefactors
fit to the MD simulation data. The results for PaTonB and HpTonB simulations with different
water models are shown in Figs. \ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATA} and \ref{HsTonBrelaxationDATA},
respectivelty. 
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{../Figs/RELdataPsTonB.eps}%
  \caption{A) Structures sampled by PsTonB from MD simulations
    (100 structures from 400ns long trajectory).
    B) Spin relaxation rates, order parameters and effective internal correlation
    times from experiments and simulations. Spin relaxation rates indicate increased flexibility
    only for the last two residues in N terminus. However,
    MD simulations suggest somewhat smaller order parameters and longer $\tau_e$
    for residues 246-253. By looking at the sampled structures, it seems that lower
    order parameters and longer correlation times arise from slower and less extensive
    conformational sampling than in HpTonB-107. Lower order parameters and larger
    correlation times are also observed in PsTonB simulations between residues 265-275.
    This can be explained by the changes in orientation of alpha helix close to this
    region, as seen in the sampled conformations. Such effect was not seen in the HpTonB
    simulations, however, NMR data for this region showed some unclarities which may arise
    from such conformational exchange. Enhanced sampling is also observed between
    residues 320-326. This was not observed in HpTonB samples, which may be related to the
    formation of beta sheet between residues 315-318 in PsTonB.Relaxation parameters for PsTonB from

For PaTonB $T_1$ and $T_1/T_2$ ratio are slightly underestimated  systemically in all simulations.
For HpTonB tip4p gives good agreement with experiments but tip3p results are
significantly off. Underestimation of $T_1/T_2$ ratio suggests that the global rotational
diffusion is overestimated in simulations \cite{??}. Thus, we tested if scaling of
diffusion coefficients with constant factor gives better agreement with experiments. 
%As described in section \ref{MDanalysis}, the global rotational diffusion coefficients
%around all intertia axes can be scaled with a constants and the resulting rotational
%correlation functions can be calculated.
Rotational diffusion coefficients for PaTonB simulation with tip4p and HpTonB simulation with tip3p
were first divided by factors 1.2 and 2.9, respectively. Then, the new correlation functions $C_N(t)$
were calculated by using timescales determined from scaled diffusion constants and prefactors
from the fit to the overall correlation functions. The spin relaxation results from these
correlation functions are shown in Figs. \ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATAscaled} and
\ref{HpTonBrelaxationDATAscaled} for PsTonB and HpTonB, respectively,
are in good agreement with experiments. This suggests that the new correlation functions
with the scaled diffusion coefficients can be used to interpret the protein rotational
dynamics from NMR relaxation data.

The rotational diffusion coefficients after the scaling are shown in Table \ref{ROTdiffCOEFFSscaled}.
These diffusion constants applied in the global rotational correlation functions give
spin relaxation times in good agreement with experiments, thus these can be considered
as an interperation of NMR relaxation data. The diffusion coefficients from tip3p simulation for HpTonB-92
with scaled diffusion constants (Table \ref{ROTdiffCOEFFSscaled}) and slightly smaller
than diffusion coefficients from tip4p simulation (Table \ref{ROTdiffCOEFFS}), which also
gave a relatively good agreement with experiments. However, the scaled results from
tip3p simulation gives slighltly better agreement for $T_1/T_2$ ratio and, thus, a
better interpretation for experiments.

\subsection{Protein internal relaxation}

Simulations in good agreement with spin relaxation data can be used
to interpret internal relaxation and order of proteins. For example,
in PsTonB low order parameters and larger effective correlation times
are observed in Fig. \ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATA} B) for residues 246-251
in N-terminus, residues 260-274, residues 300-303, residues 320-326
and residues 338-342 in C-terminus. The results in terminal ends
(residues 246-251 and 338-342)
can be explained by the increased flexibility of unstructured endings
of the protein, which are also seen in overlayed structures in
Fig.~\ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATA} A). Low order parameters and
large effective correlation times between residues 260-274 arise
from two different orientations sampled by alpha helix on that region, as also
seen in Fig.~\ref{PsTonBrelaxationDATA} A). This explains also the
lower resolution in NMR spectra observed for that region \cite{??}.
Between residues 320-326 decrease in NOE and $T_1/T_2$ ratio and increase
in $T_2$ are also observed in simulations and experiments. The results
can be explained by the increased flexbility of the loop in this region
as also seen in overlayed structures. Low order parameters and large
effective correlation times between residues 300-303 are not seen
in spin relaxation data, thus it is not clear if these arise from
simulation artefact.

Also for HpTonB low order parameters and long effetive correlation times
are observed only for flexible terminal ends (residues 196-197 and 283-285)
as seen in Fig. \ref{HPTonBrelaxationDATA}. Low order parameters and long
effetive correlation times and for residues 245-250 probably arise
(at least partly) from simulation artefacts because deviation form experimental
relaxation data is relatively large for these residues.
Different orientations of alpha helix between residues 210-220 and
decreased order parameters are not observed in contrast to PsTonB,
except single large effective correlation time value at residue 218.
The low resolution in NMR spectra \cite{??}, however, suggest that
the same phenomena is present but not observed in simulations, possibly
due to timescale or force field issues.

\section{Conclusions}

Rotation of protein intertia axes is observed to experience linear
diffusion behaviour and overall diffusion component of rotational 
correlation functions of individual N-H bonds can can be successfully 
fitted to the model assuming anitropic diffusion for whole molecule.

Rotational diffusion of whole molecules is overestimated by a factor
of $\sim$3 in simulations with tip3p water, in agreement with previous
studies \cite{??}. The simulations with tip4p and opc4 water models
give more realistic diffusion coefficients, which overestimate diffusion
only with factors $\sim$1-1.2. 

The overstimated overall diffusion
coefficient can be corrected post-simulationally to compare internal dynamics
and order with experiments. 

The presented methodology can be used to interpret spin relaxation experiments
by using MD simulations \cite{??} and asses the quality of protein force fields
against NMR experiments. The presented scaling of overall anisotropic diffusion
allows this also for simulations with incorrect rotational diffusion due to water
models, which is the case in simulations with tip3p.
